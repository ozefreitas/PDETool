# PlastEDMA
## Plastic Enzymes Degrading for Metagenomic databases Analysis
#### Version 0.1.0

PlastEDMA is a user friendly CLI workflow for the detection of plastic degrading enzymes in metagenomic samples, through structural annotation ussing Hidden Markov Models, that allows the user to freely interacte with the tool in-built databases and backbone.
PlastEDMA compreends a extensive HMM database built with state of the art checked enzymatic sequences able to degrade plastic polymers, which is used to carry the structural annotation of given sequences.
First version of PlastEDMA is only available for mining PE (polyethylene).
